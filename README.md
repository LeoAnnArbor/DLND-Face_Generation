#  Face Generation

### [_**Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation**_](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101) from Udacity

### **Project 3**

In this project we build a Deep [Generative Adversarial Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network) (GAN) using [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) to create new faces from scratch based on Large-scale CelebFaces Attributes [CelebA](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) Dataset. The project was written in Python (on a [_Jupyter Notebook_](https://github.com/HaraldoFilho/DLND-tv-script-generation/blob/master/dlnd_tv_script_generation.ipynb)) using the libraries _numpy_ and _tensorflow_, running on an _Anaconda_ environment and the GAN is trianed on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)
